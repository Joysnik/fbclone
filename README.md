# m-Facebook (Minimlistik Facebook)

This project is a minimalistic implementation of core facebook features. It explores funtionalities like ``creating account``, ``writing posts and comments (text only)``, ``liking and commenting`` on other people's posts, ``sending / accepting / canceling friend requests`` and ``semi-realtime`` friend request notifications.

Profile management is minimal, real-time newsfeed, notifications, ads, and IM are not yet implemented.
